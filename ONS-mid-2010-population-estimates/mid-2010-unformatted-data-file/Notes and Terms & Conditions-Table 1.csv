,Mid-2010 Population Estimates: Single year of age and sex for local authorities in the United Kingdom; estimated resident population.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Contents,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Estimated resident population by single year of age group for constituent countries; counties; London boroughs and districts in England; unitary authorities in Wales; council areas within ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Scotland and district council areas in Northern Ireland.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Notes and Definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,1. It is ONS policy to publish population estimates rounded to at least the nearest hundred persons.  These unit-level estimates are provided to enable and encourage further calculations and ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"    analysis.  However, the estimates cannot be guaranteed to be as exact as the level of detail implied by unit-level data.  We request that data are rounded to the nearest 100 if quoted in any ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"    publication, documentation or similar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"2. The estimated resident population of an area includes all people who usually live there, whatever their nationality.  People arriving into an area from outside the UK are only included in the ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,    population estimates if their total stay in the UK is 12 months or more.  Visitors and short term migrants (those who enter the UK for 3 to 12 months for certain purposes) are not included.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"    Similarly, people who leave the UK are only excluded from the population estimates if they remain outside the UK for 12 months or more.  This is consistent with the United Nations ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,    recommended definition of an international long-term migrant.  Members of UK and non-UK armed forces stationed in the UK are included in the population and UK forces stationed outside ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,    the UK are excluded.  Students are taken to be resident at their term time address.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"3. At a subnational level, the population estimates reflect boundaries that were in place on 1 April of the reference year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,4. Figures for Northern Ireland are only available to 85+ at a subnational level.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"5. Codes are those used by ONS from 1 January 2011, in line with the UK coding and naming policy for statistical geographies.  A lookup for the previous codes is available at",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,http://www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/geography/products/geog-products-area/names-codes/index.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,6. Local estimates are now calculated by single year of age; but these figures are less reliable and we advise that single year of age data for local areas should be aggregated to at least ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"    five-year age groupings for use in further calculations, onwards circulation, or for presentation purposes. (Splitting into 0 year olds and 1-4 year olds is an acceptable exception).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,7. Further advice on the appropriate use of these data can be obtained by emailing pop.info@ons.gsi.gov.uk or phoning 01329 444661 and asking to speak to a statistician.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
